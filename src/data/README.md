# Data Used in the Project
- **STEP 1 : As for this Challenge Two Datasets were intially finalized from Kaggle**.
1. [**Garbage Classification (6 classes): Refered as Dataset 1**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification)
2. [**Garbage Classification (12 classes): Refered as Dataset 11**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification)

- **STEP 2  :Further as Models were being made and tested it with,Garbage Classification (12 classes) was finalised to work with**.

- **STEP 3 : Further Images were added and classes were reduced to create a final Dataset for the model from Garbage Classification (12 classes)**
