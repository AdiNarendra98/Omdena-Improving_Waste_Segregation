## SUMMARY OF TASK 1

**Aim** :
 - To Collect all the relevant resources that would be required to start the project. These include finding relevant papers, datasets, tools that can be used in the further tasks.

**Work Done** :
 - We collected over 11 relevant datasets coevering across 20 distinct classes of garbage items.
 - Collected and discussed 8 papers that included previous work and closely related work in vision for recognition of objects.
 - Worked through various notebooks on Kaggle and Github Repos that have done previous work in the same area of application.
 - Conducted two meeting where we skimmed over all the resources that we collected and otehr one for finalising the datasets and tools to be used for further tasks.

**Challenges Faced** :
 - Most datasets have over-sampled the no.of images in one or two particular category which can lead to improper results.
 - Need to finalize on the no.of distinct classes that are relevant to the place for application in general
