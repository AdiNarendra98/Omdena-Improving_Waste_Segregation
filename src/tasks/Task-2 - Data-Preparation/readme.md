## SUMMARY OF TASK 2

### **Aim** :
 - To create a final dataset for model building through required data pre processing techniques such as sampling, resizing , data augmentation etc. Also work towards modification of dataset as per they requirements of task 3 and task 4 teams. 

### **Work Done** :
- From the two for the finalised datasets, Dataset 1 and Dataset 11 images were categorised and sorted numerically.
- The Sampling processes were completed as per the requirements of the initial models which was discussed in the weekly meetings.
- Further images were also cleaned, augmented  and resized as per final model’s req.
- Four Versions of Datasets were made and as per the voting process Garbage Seg 10 V5 was finalised for model building and deployment purpose. 


### **Challenges Faced** :
- Due to Incorrect naming of the images under class labels, they had to manually sorted which was a tedious task.
- Many images were not resized as per our requirements and so proper rescaling was done.
