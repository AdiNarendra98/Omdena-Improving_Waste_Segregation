# Task 3 
-  **The Task 3 dealts with building models for each dataset and they have been displayed here under respective folders**.

- **Each Folder Contains the Models made by all the contributors and also contains the final model file that can be used for deployment**

## SUMMARY OF TASK 3

### **Aim** :
 - To create various models for the finalised dataset using various computer vision algorithms  and finally find a proper model for real world usage.â€¨

### **Work Done** :
- Initially 4 various datasets were made to be tested so around 10 different architectures and algorithms were tested on each of them.
- Through continuous meetings top 5 models based on testing accuracies were carried forward to the Task 4 team  for further  deployment.
- Subsequent debugging and code were optimised for easy deployment.
- All the models tested were recorded with their computational time and accuracy.

### **Challenges Faced** :
- Due to the high no.of algorithms present in working it was a time consuming task to create around 10 models for each of the 4 datasets.
- Newer algorithms like VGG16 were modified by prior references from blogposts and research papers which took some time to get running.
