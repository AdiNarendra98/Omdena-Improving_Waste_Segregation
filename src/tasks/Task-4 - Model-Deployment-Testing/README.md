# TASK 4

### For the purpose of Final Deployment we decided for two Frameworks:

1. [**Gradio + Hugging Faces**](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/bengaluru-india-improve-sorting-segregation/tree/main/src/tasks/Task-4%20-%20Model-Deployment-Testing/Gradio%2BHF%20Deployments)

2. [**Streamlit**](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/bengaluru-india-improve-sorting-segregation/tree/main/src/tasks/Task-4%20-%20Model-Deployment-Testing/streamlit)

### For Final Deployment we went ahead with **Gradio + Hugging Faces** due to:

- Easy App Building Process
- Time Saving
- Reliable Hosting

## SUMMARY OF TASK 4

### **Aim** :
 - To Successfully deploy the models provided by Task 3 team into Gradio and Streamlit and also test the real world performance.  

### **Work Done** :
- For each models created which were around 10 in number they were individually deployed to Gradio and Streamlit.
- The deployed models were tested on 100 new images from each class with varied settings and their respective accuracies were noted.
- Conducted meetings to optimise the models for desired outputs and accuracies.
- Through polling in the group and weekly discussions Gradio was prefered over Streamlit for easier app building process and also for reliable hosting on Hugging Faces.
- Conducted hands on sessions for teaching the deployment process to the team members for active participation in Task 4.

### **Challenges Faced** :
 - Many of the models didn’t have optimised codes which slowed down the deployment process which were subsequently worked on again.
