# TASK 4

### For the purpose of Final Deployment we decided for two Frameworks:

1. [**Gradio + Hugging Faces**](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/bengaluru-india-improve-sorting-segregation/tree/main/src/tasks/Task-4%20-%20Model-Deployment-Testing/Gradio%2BHF%20Deployments)

2. [**Streamlit**](https://github.com/OmdenaAI/bengaluru-india-improve-sorting-segregation/tree/main/src/tasks/Task-4%20-%20Model-Deployment-Testing/streamlit)

### For Final Deployment we went ahead with **Gradio + Hugging Faces** due to:

- Easy App Building Process
- Time Saving
- Reliable Hosting
